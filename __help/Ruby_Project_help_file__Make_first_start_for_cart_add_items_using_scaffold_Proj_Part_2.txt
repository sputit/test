# need to decide what kind of information we need to show and query in the finsihed project
# need to add for gluten-free so that is searchable..

# need image, category, title, desription, price

# but definitely as Liam is really tough marker
# i think we would need a file uploader so that we don't have 
# add images by hand into the image folder each time

# have to look that it is a good UX experience for the admin/client person
# who has to add new cakes each time

# might need id but maybe rails has it already covered

#rails generate scaffold item image:string title:string category:string description:text price:decimal glutenfree:boolean icing:boolean filling:string other:string

rails generate scaffold item image:string title:string category:string description:text price:decimal glutenfree:boolean icing:boolean filling:string other:string

# let's make the database...

rake db:migrate # THIS IS NEEDED TO CREATE THE SCHEMA RUBY FILE
rake db:migrate db/schema.rb # NOTE: need the direrctory db/ in the command

## handy undo commands

rake db:rollback

#You can create scaffolding using:
rails generate scaffold MyFoo 

#(or similar), and you can destroy/undo it using 
rails destroy scaffold MyFoo

rails destroy controller MyFoo
rails destroy model MyFoo


#and run
rails server -b $IP -p $PORT
